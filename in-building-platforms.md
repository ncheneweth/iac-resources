# Necessary sustained architectural characteristics of a platform  

In building Platforms the following characteristics must be sustained...  
* complexity constrained
* comprehension
* observability
* idp integrated rbac
* agility


### complexity constrained

The platform must provide the centrally managed, architectural solution to the challenges of a distributed computing architecture. The consequences of not taking the _network fallacies of distributed computing_ seriously will manifest, it's just a question of time.  

### comprehension

Good design documentation, loosely coupled pipelines around continuously evaluated domains, constant adhereance to the engineering practices of a healthy SDLC - these are all necessary to maintain a high level of understanding within the 'product' oriented team building the platform.  Maintaining effective observability is highly depending on the level of understanding developers have about the software they are writing.  

### observability

### idp integrated rbac

### agility

The leadership and stakeholders enabling the develoment of the platform must be committed to a platform roadmap that is evolutionary in nature. Regular refactoring, updates, and technolgy changes are a integral and healthy part of sustaining the value of a platform. It is not something you finish, it can not be purchased like COTS. There are vendors who offer such solutions. Know that these are effective solutions for organizations who are committed to sustaining functional silos, maintaining regressive IT delivery practices, and believing that IT is fundamentally a cost center. Subsequently such products are likewise a point of friction and high-cost/low-value spending for organizations committed to designing quality into engineering, progressive (even disruptive) delivery models, and making IT a partner with the business in delivering increased value.
